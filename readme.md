# Oral History App
This is an application for oral histories. A user is asked to create a username and password and then an account is created with a unique avatar. The user is then able to log in and add text from an interview and have it store in a database. The database is then retrievable. 

## Instructions
The app is fairly easy to use for users inexperienced in html. Once an interview is translated into text, a user logged into their account can paste the text and have it stored into a database within their account.

* Create and load virtual environment in a subdirectory, for example we created one called "venv"
```
virtualenv venv
```
* Activate the virtual environment (it will say venv infront of the directory location on the command prompt, that is how you know you are in the virtual environment)
